Documentation
Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with Jekyll and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at http://getbootstrap.com. The docs may also be run locally.

Running documentation locally

If necessary, install Jekyll (requires v1.x).
Windows users: Read this unofficial guide to get Jekyll up and running without problems. We use Pygments for syntax highlighting, so make sure to read the sections on installing Python and Pygments.
From the root /bootstrap directory, run jekyll serve in the command line.
Windows users: While we use Jekyll's encoding setting, you might still need to change the command prompt's character encoding (code page) to UTF-8 so Jekyll runs without errors. For Ruby 2.0.0, run chcp 65001 first. For Ruby 1.9.3, you can alternatively do SET LANG=en_EN.UTF-8.
Open http://localhost:9001 in your browser, and voilÃ .
Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its documentation.

Documentation for v2.3.2 has been made available for the time being at http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/ while folks transition to Bootstrap 3.

Previous releases and their documentation are also available for download.

Versioning
For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap is maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines. Sometimes we screw up, but we'll adhere to these rules whenever possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major while resetting minor and patch
New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor while resetting the patch
Bug fixes and misc changes bumps only the patch
For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.
